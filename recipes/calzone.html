<p>The calzone is a great dish that can be made in all sorts of ways. Usually inside a calzone it will contain a cheese, a protein ,and veggies.</p>
 <p>Sometimes people will only have a protein or a veggie instead of both. But it will almost always come with cheese because who doesnt love a good cheese pull.</p>
 <p>Calzone also goes great with a side of marinara.</p>
