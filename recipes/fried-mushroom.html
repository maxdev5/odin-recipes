<p>One of my favorite appetizers fried mushrooms is a dish that is simple to make while also being delicious.</p>
<p>After having all preparation set it should only take around 10 minutes to cook. First 5 would be having it in the fryer and last 5 would be to let cool.</p>
<p>Once its been cook and cool down. It'll be cripsy on the outside you will taste all the seasoning and inside will be the soft mushrooms inside that feel like it melting in your mouth. It also goes great with marinara.</p>

<h3>Direction</h3>
<ol>

    <li>Add water to make a batter.</li>

    <li>I find it easier to stick a toothpick into the mushroom to dip it.</li>
